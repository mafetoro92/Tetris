# Tetris

Tetris is a classic game. The game requires players to rotate and move falling Tetris pieces. Players clear lines by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty cells. If the pieces reach the top, the game is over. 

To make Tetris, youâ€™ll need to know:
 - HTML
- CSS styling
- JavaScript classes, variables, and scope
